# Interactive Neural Style Transfer Project

This project captures an image from your webcam, applies different artistic styles using neural style transfer, and displays the results. The project is designed to be run on Google Colab, making it easy for anyone to use without needing to install any software locally.

## Overview

Neural style transfer is a technique that uses deep neural networks to apply the style of one image (the style image) to another image (the content image). In this project, we use a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub to apply the styles of famous paintings and artistic patterns to images captured from your webcam.

## Features

- Capture images directly from your webcam.
- Apply different artistic styles to your captured images.
- Use a pre-trained neural style transfer model for high-quality results.
- Easily extendable with new styles by simply adding URLs of style images.

## Requirements

- Google Colab account
- Webcam access for capturing images

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or copy the code into a Google Colab notebook and follow along.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-style-transfer-project.git
